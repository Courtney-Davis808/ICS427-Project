### Running the project
Either download the jar file from the release page, or clone the repo and compile Main class in the ics427 directory found in src>main>java
Enter ```java -jar ics427.jar login``` into the command line to login to the project. Follow the prompts afterward.

### Closing thoughts
* Just setting up the file structure to get the project to run with all the dependencies was quite challenging. 
* Did not know you could generate a database from a jar file
* Generating the secure database was pretty cool
* It would be nice to add more commands, but I don't know what else would be handy to have.
* Your passwords are your responsibility. If something goes wrong and your credentials are lost, it is on you.
