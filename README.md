### Running the project
Either download the jar file from the release page, or clone the repo and compile Main class in the ics427 directory found in src>main>java
Enter ```java -jar ics427.jar login``` into the command line to login to the project. Follow the prompts afterward.

If this is your first time using the app, you need to create a login, to do this use the -c flag like this: java -jar ics427.jar login -c.

### Closing thoughts
* MICHAEL CHUN:
* Trying to make sure the methods were easy to integrate by other team member was time consuming and difficult
* This project really emphasized that a lot of planning needs to be done to both ensure security is accounted for and planning for integration purposes
* Learning how to work with both SQLite and all the different encryption methods and libraries was helpful, but difficult
* Learning about all the different ways to encrypt, hash, and protect your data was very helpful when approaching future projects
* I wish I could take more time to implement other secure features to help make it more functional as well as more secure. Things like changing master login passwords, en/decrypting the usernames as well, and finding a way to encrypt the entire database in a unintrusive way.
* I'm proud I was able to successfully learn how to create secure database practices and use salting/hashing/encryption/decryption/etc.
* TREY YASUNAGA:
* Just setting up the file structure to get the project to run with all the dependencies was quite challenging.
* Did not know you could generate a database from a jar file
* Generating the secure database was pretty cool
* It would be nice to add more commands, but I don't know what else would be handy to have.
* DISCLAIMER:
* Your passwords are your responsibility. If something goes wrong and your credentials are lost, it is on you.
* COURTNEY DAVIS
* I learned all sorts of things about coding
* This is the first time I've used GitHub! I will use it in future project. I'm actually going to use GitHub to import a vulnerability into a box for a DOD cyber games project.
* I learned ALOT about secure coding practices that will help be in my future career as a cybersecurity specialist.
* Mike and Trey were great partners to have for this project.
